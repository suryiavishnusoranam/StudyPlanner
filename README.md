# Overview

{Brief description of my Study Planner Program:}

The software I created is called the Study Planner Program. This is developed in C++. It allows users to manage tasks. This includes the options to
add, view, and mark tasks as completed. The program comes with an interface (terminal) where users can input the names and dates of tasks. This then 
can be stored in memory. Tasks can be projected (showed) to the user onto the terminal with the details of the tasks which should include status of completion. 
Users are given the options to mark tasks as completed which allows them to update their status as desired. Furthermore, the program gives the ability to save and
send recorded tasks to a file (tasks.txt) just in case if users want to store and load them in the future. The software allows users to effectively organize and plan their
study timetable.

{My purpose of writing this program:}

The purpose of me writing this software was to develop a useful affirmation of C++ programming concepts. This includes providing efficient tool to manage and organize tasks, 
especially when it comes to planning study timetables. Through developing this software, my goal was to demonstrate the core C++ language features such as classes, 
functions, operations, and user input interacting in a real-world example. Furthermore, I aimed to be able to come up with a simple, also useful tool that is targeted to benefit 
users by assisting them keep with keeping tabs of their study activities, developing a better time management, and refining their productivity. Eventually, the end goal was to 
develop a C++ project that meets both educational and practical objective.

{Provide a link to your YouTube demonstration. It should be a 4-5 minute demo of the software running and a walkthrough of the code. Focus should be on sharing what you learned about the language syntax.}

# Development Environment

{Description of tools that I used to develop this software:}

I developed the study planner software using JetBrains CLion as my Integrated Development Environment (IDE). CLion provided an intuitive interface 
and advanced features like code completion and integrated debugging tools, enhancing my productivity throughout the development process. Additionally, 
I make use of GitHub as my version control system (VCS) which allows me to track changes to the source code, working with team members, and manage project 
versions effectively. With the combination of CLion for writing and managing the code and GitHub for version control and collaboration, I was able to 
develop the study planner software efficiently and ensure its quality and maintainability.

{Description of the programming language that I used and any libraries.}

The study planner software was developed using the C++ programming language. Leveraging the C++ Standard Library, 
particularly the std::vector container class, the software efficiently managed tasks by allowing flexible storage and streamlined 
addition/removal of elements. While the project did not rely on external libraries, it showcased C++'s capability to construct 
robust applications through its intrinsic features, underscoring the language's versatility and suitability for such endeavors.

# Future Work

{List of things that I need to fix, improve, and add in the future.}

- Fix: Finding out issues by identifying bugs in code that potentially or currently affects the software's functionality.
- Improvements:
1. Refactor and optimize code for better maintainability and readability. 
2. Enhance the user interface for improved usability and visual appeal.
